# Functions Activity
<b>Description</b>
This activity is used to teach students what functions are in programming and how useful they are.

The code is broken up into three phases for the students to step through and understand why each phase is important to their understanding of functions. The first phase is to show students why writing the same blocks of code could be tedious to do. After this step the second phase is to show how creating functions can get rid of the tedious writing of code blocks and how parameters work with functions. The third and final phase is just to allow the students to again understand why writing functions helps with programming.
